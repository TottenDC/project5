TechDegree Unit 5 Project - Use a Public API to Create an Employee Directory

Purpose:
-Practice AJAX requests and JSON-based data object manipulation
-Create a mock multi-national employee directory with modal windows.

Note:
-Original CSS file and HTML curtesy of Treehouse.
-I only added script tags to link JavaScript and jQuery pages to the HTML.
-I created all JavaScript files and code.
-I modified color scheme in CSS (background colors and text colors).

Goals:
-Create AJAX request to grab 12 users from a random-user generating API
  -Dynamically create user cards to display on main page that show basic information.
-Create a modal window that opens when a user card is clicked.
  -Display additional information in the window.
  -Create buttons to toggle between employees.
-Utilize standardized code commenting
